## Final project from software design

The final project from our software design class.
Basically, it emulates a volunteering system that connects donators of goods (such as food or medicine) to those who need it.
It's a fairly simple console program that is navigated by entering numbers into the console window and navigating the its submenus.


Simple, but complex.
